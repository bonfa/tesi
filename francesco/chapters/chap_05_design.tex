	\section{The Architecture}
	Image \todo{}, shows the context in which the software is inserted. 
	From one side, there are \mbox{ACT-R} models, interpreted and executed by \mbox{Lisp} interpreters. 
	This part is not discussed in this work but is fundamental for the choices about the communication protocol.
	On the other hand, there is the vision module, which is the main object of this work.
	The two parts communicate to each other thanks to a \mbox{client-server} communication mechanism based on \mbox{TCP/IP} protocol.

	This work focuses on the vision module, whose main goals are extracting features from input data and sending them to \mbox{ACT-R} models in a way that can be supported and understood by the cognitive architecture. 
	This software does not take part in the cognitive reasoning.
	It only send the information needed to the model,  
No reasoning is made in this part of the software
