  %% Cognitive Architecture
\begin{comment}
 \section{Cognitive Architecture}	
	A cognitive architecture is the implementation through computer simulation softwares \todo{controllare correttezza di softwares} of a theory about human cognition. The theory generally relies on a wide selection of human experimental data. The design of these architectures tries to simulate human intelligence in a humanlike way.
	
	
	
	As the term \emph{infrastructure} suggests, cognitive architectures usually are built aggregating many software modules, most of which represent functions of the human brain. Anyway, there exist other modules, which coordinate the overall functioning and without which the whole architecture could not work. In the following section, which describes \emph{ACT-R}, the \emph{procedural module} is an example of such modules. In fact, it does not represent a function of the human being, though it is necessary to coordinate the communication between all the other modules. 
	
	Some architectures, can, in addition, include some \emph{learning mechanisms}. This can be the attempt to simulate the human memory system, thanks to which the behaviour of a human can be different after having experienced facts or consequences of a specific choice ~\cite{Sears2012}.

  %% ACT-R
  \section{ACT-R}
	\mbox{ACT-R}, that stands for \emph{Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational}, is a cognitive architecture, i.e. a computer implementation of a theory about human cognition. As such, it models the structure and behavior of the human brain trying to explain how all the components of the brain work together and form the human mind.

	The following sections describe the theory on which ACT-R relies, how the theory is implemented in the framework and the concept of \emph{model}.  

\begin{comment}
	 
	\mbox{ACT-R} is a software written in Lisp and its models are written in a Lisp-like language. It is thought to have a modular structure so that it can be easily extended. The current version of the software is the 6.0.

	\subsection{The Theory Behind ACT-R}
		The following section describes two fundamental assumptions on which ACT-R relies, the \emph{Unified Theory About Cognition} and the classification of the human memory in \emph{declarative} and \emph{procedural}. Both of these assumptions are important because they determinate the structure of the framework.
		
		\subsubsection{Unified Theory About Cognition}
		\mbox{ACT-R} implements the homonym theory developed by John Robert Anderson, professor of psychology and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Such theory tries to explain the overall behavior of the human mind through connections between its well-defined components that, combined together, form an integrated system. The following quote, that explains the meaning of integrated system, comes from Allen Newell, the man who inspired Anderson in creating ACT-R theory~\cite{Anderson04anintegrated}.

		\begin{quote}
		A single system (mind) produces all aspects of behavior. It is one mind that minds them all. Even if the mind has parts, modules, components, or whatever, they all mesh together to produce behavior. Any bit of behavior has causal tendrils that extend back through large parts of the total cognitive system before grounding in the environmental situation of some earlier times. If a theory covers only one part or component, it flirts with trouble from the start. It goes without saying that there are dissociations, independencies, impenetrabilities, and modularities. These all help to break the web of each bit of behavior being shaped by an unlimited set of antecedents. So they are important to understand and help to make that theory simple enough to use. But they donâ€™t remove the necessity of a theory that provides the total picture and explains the role of the parts and why they exist~\cite[p.17-18]{newell1994unified}.
		\end{quote}

  

		\subsubsection{Declarative memory and procedural memory}
		In psychology, \emph{memory} is defined as the processes by which information is encoded, stored and retrieved ~\cite{baddeley2009memory}. 
	
		\mbox{ACT-R's} most important assumption about knowledge is based on Anderson's theory about memory. 
		Anderson divides memory into \emph{declarative} and \emph{procedural}~\cite{Anderson04anintegrated}. 
	
		Declarative memory refers to all the information that can be consciously recalled. This kind of knowledge comprehends facts and notions that human beings explicitly know. To call back this kind of information, there must be a conscious process by the human being. For this reason, this kind of memory is also called \emph{explicit}.
	
		In contrast, procedural memory refers to all that notions or skills that human beings have but which they learnt in an implicit way. Examples of this knowledge are driving, reading and writing. In this case, in order to call back this kind of information, the human being does not need a conscious process. That is why this kind of memory is also called \emph{implicit}~\cite{anderson1976language}. 
			
		When a person starts learning typewriting, for example, an attempt he can make in the beginning is trying to memorize the layout of the keyboard. The aware knowledge of all the positions of the keys is the declarative memory. After having become a skilled typewriter, the same person will type faster putting his fingers on the right keys and pushing them in the correct order, without thinking anymore about the positions of the keys on the keyboard. Moreover, if someone asks him where the position of a certain character is on the keyboard, he will probably answer that he can not say it without looking at it. This is because, now, for this task he is using his procedural memory~\cite{anderson1993rules}.
	
	\subsection{The Architecture}
		 This section, after having defined \emph{chunks} and \emph{productions}, the building blocks of ACT-R structure, presents the architecture of the framework.

		\subsubsection{Chunks and productions}
		In \mbox{ACT-R}, declarative memory is represented by structures, called \emph{chunks}, and procedural memory  by rules, called \emph{productions}. Chunks and productions are the basic building blocks of ACT-R \emph{models}. The concept of model will be described in \ref{modelSect}.
	
		The \emph{chunks} are data structures which are defined by their \emph{type} and their \emph{attribute list}. This is a tuple of pairs, each of which is made up by a fixed part and a variable part.
		The fixed part is the \emph{name} of the attribute and is called \emph{slot}.
		The variable part is the \emph{value} of the attribute.
		Each chunk has also a \emph{name} but it is not considered to be a part of the chunk itself, as it does not exist in \mbox{ACT-R} theory. It is used only for convenience to reference the specific chunk when writing models. The chunk-types can be organized into hierarchies.
	
		The \emph{productions} are \mbox{ACT-R} equivalent of functions. They define sequences of actions and can be fired only if a set of preconditions is satisfied. They can be represented as \emph{if-then} rules, where the \emph{if-part} is a set of conditions that must be true for the production to apply and the \emph{then-part} is the action of the production and consists of the operations the model should perform when the production is selected and used. 

		In general there could be some conflicts between productions. This happens when preconditions of two or more productions are satisfied at the same time. In these cases the production to be fired is the one with the highest \emph{utility value}, a numeric quantity which gives a priority measure. It can be set a priori by the modeler or learnt while the model is running. The latter, together with the fact that in the calculation of this value the probability of reaching the goal and the time estimate are included, constitutes the basis of the learning mechanism embedded in \mbox{ACT-R}: the more successfully a production is, the more its estimated probability and utility grow, increasing the probability for that production to be selected again~\cite{actr6refman}.
	

		\subsubsection{Organization of the Modules}
		All the activities carried out by the human brain, like talking or moving, are performed by neurons located close together in a well defined and limited area of the cortex. Trying to imitate this "architecture", \mbox{ACT-R's} framework is structured in different \emph{modules}, each of which represents one specific function of the human brain. 
	
		Figure \ref{fig:modulesActr} shows the modular structure of ACT-R. In the picture you can see two groups of modules, separated by the \emph{procedural module}. 
	
		The first group comprehends \emph{visual}, \emph{aural}, \emph{manual } and \emph{vocal modules}. These let the model interact with the environment.
		The \emph{visual module} is responsible for recognizing objects in the visual scene and shifting the focus to them. Similarly, the \emph{aural module} identifies sounds and moves the attention to them. 
		The \emph{manual module} can move the virtual hands and perform actions like pressing the key on a keyboard or moving the mouse while the \emph{vocal module} controls the virtual voice.
	
		The other group comprehends \emph{goal module}, \emph{imaginal module} and \emph{declarative module}. These represent the internal information of the model.  
		The \emph{goal module} provides the system with the structure of the goal of the task, defined as a chunk. 
		The \emph{imaginal module} has to contain and update the current context relevant to the current task. 
		The \emph{declarative module} provides the model with a declarative memory, thus it stores the declarative chunks generated by the model and provides a mechanism for retrieving them. 
	
		Finally, the \emph{procedural module} is responsible of the communication and the coordination of all the other modules.

		    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/ch_01/actr.eps}
		  \end{center} 
		  \caption{\textit{Structure of ACT-R.}}  
		  \label{fig:modulesActr}
		\end{figure}
	
	
		All the modules are independent of each other, they do not share variables or information. They can communicate with each other through \emph{buffers}, which represent the interface of a module towards the others. A module can have no buffers as well as one or more than one. The communication consists in exchanging chunks. Each module can read chunks from every buffer but it can make changes only to the chunks in its own buffers. Moreover each buffer can hold one chunk at a time. 

		Although modules usually work in a parallel way, their interactions can be only serial.
		There are two reasons for this limitation: the first one is that the structure of the buffers can hold only one chunk at a time and the second one is that only one production can be fired at a time~\cite{actr6refman}.
	
	\subsection{ACT-R Models}\label{modelSect}
	ACT-R is able to perform several task-independent reasoning. 
	To adapt these reasoning to a single task it is necessary an additional layer called \emph{model}.

	Each model contains the specific modelers' assumptions about the task within ACT-R view of cognition. That knowledge is expressed through productions that, when the model is running, interact with the modules, querying them and reading their buffers. 
	
	Running a model produces a series of atomic cognitive operations which step-by-step leads to the solution of the task. Each operation is associated with quantitative and qualitative measures like the correctness of the goal and the time necessary to complete the operation.
	This fact gives the model the possibility to predict the sequence of cognitive actions produced by human beings when they try to solve the same task.
	Comparisons with human performances can be useful to evaluate the quality of the models~\cite{Sears2012}.

	ACT-R is written in Lisp and provides its own lisp-like language for the modelers to write the models.

  %% OPENCV
  \section{OpenCV}
	\mbox{OpenCV}, an abbreviation that stands for \emph{Open Source Computer Vision}, is a computer vision library that was originally developed by Intel and, later on, by Willow Garage.
	It is a cross-platform library and can run under Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. 
	It is released under a BSD license, thus it is free and open source. 
	In the beginning it was developed in C and C++ and afterwards it was expanded by the addition of interfaces for other languages as, for example, Java, Python, Ruby and Matlab. 

	\mbox{OpenCV} is designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. On Intel architectures there is the possibility to further optimize the library thanks to Intel's \emph{IPP} library. IPP library, that stands for \emph{Integrated Performance Primitives}, contains a series of low-level optimized routines in many different algorithmic areas. If this library is installed, \mbox{OpenCV} uses it automatically at runtime.

	\mbox{OpenCV} offers a simple to use infrastructure that helps programmers create quite complicated vision applications in an acceptable time. The version 2.4 has more than 2500 algorithms that covers many areas of vision. The library has been used in many applications as, for example, mine inspection and robotics 
	It also contains \emph{MLL}, a full and general purpose \emph{Machine Learning Library}, which allows provides functions for pattern recognition and clustering\cite{bradski2008learning}. 

	The following sections contain a brief history of the library, a description of its main features and an overview on the architecture of the library. As the aim of this work is not to list and describe all the algorithms and techniques implemented in the computer vision library, for more information about this see texts by Trucco~\cite{trucco1998introductory} for a simple introduction, Forsyth~\cite{forsyth2011computer} as a comprehensive reference, and Hartley~\cite{hartley2003multiple} and Faugeras~\cite{faugeras1993three} for how 3D vision really works.




	
	\subsection{History}
	The \mbox{OpenCV} Project started in 1999 as an Intel Research initiative aimed to improve CPU intensive applications as a part of projects including real-time ray tracing, which in computer graphics is a particular technique for generating images, and 3D display walls. The early goals of the project were: developing optimized code for basic vision infrastructure, spreading this infrastructure to developers and making it portable and available for free, using a license that let the developers create both commercial and free applications.

	The first alpha version was released to the public in 2000, followed by five beta versions between 2001 and 2005, which lead to version 1.0 in 2006. In 2008, the technology incubator Willow Garage begun supporting the project and, in the same year, version 1.1  was released.

	In October 2009, \mbox{OpenCV} 2.0 was released. It includes many improvements, such as a better C++ interface, more programming patterns, new functions and an optimization for multi-core architectures. According to the current \mbox{OpenCV} release plan, a new version of the library is delivered on a six-months basis. \cite{OpenCV:ChangeLogs}.
	
	\subsection{Main Features}
	\mbox{OpenCV} offers a wide range of possibilities. First of all, it provides an easy way to manage image and video data types. It also offers functions to load, copy, edit, convert and store images and a basic graphical user interface that allows the developers to handle keyboard and mouse and display images and videos. The library permits to manipulate images even with matrix and vector algebra routines. It supports the most common dynamic data structures and offers many different basic image processing functions: filtering, edge and corner detection, color conversion, sampling and interpolation, morphological operations, histograms and image pyramids. Beyond this, it integrates many functions for structural analysis of the image, camera calibration, motion analysis and object recognition. \cite{Agam2006}.
	
	\subsection{Architecture}
	Since version 2.2, the OpenCV library is divided into several modules. These modules are built in library files located in the lib directory. They are:
	 The opencv core module that contains the core functionalities of the library, in   particular, the basic data structures and arithmetic functions.

	The opencv imgproc module that contains the main image processing functions.

	The opencv highgui module that contains the image and video reading and   writing functions, along with other user interface functions.

	The opencv features2d module that contains the feature point detectors and   descriptors and the feature point matching framework.

	The opencv calib3d module that contains the camera calibration, two-view   geometry estimation, and stereo functions.

	The opencv video module that contains the motion estimation, feature tracking,   and foreground extraction functions and classes.

	 The opencv objdetect module containing the object detection functions such as   the face and people detectors.

	The library also includes other utility modules containing machine learning functions (opencv ml), computational geometry algorithms (opencv flann), contributed code (opencv contrib), obsolete code (opencv legacy), and gpu accelerated code (opencv gpu).
